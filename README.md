# banner-forge
Banner Forge is a project that allows users to upload an image and customize it with a tint, a header, and other options. You can upload an image, you can add a tint to the image, intensify the tint, change the color of the tint, add a header, change the color of the header and change the size the image.

Just download the project, go to the command prompt and cd into the directory and host it using "npm run dev".

But, I already hosted the project, heres the link: https://banner-forge.netlify.app/
